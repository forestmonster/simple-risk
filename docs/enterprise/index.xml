How can you organize them so they&amp;rsquo;re tractable by large organizations? Risk measurement can be viewed as a group practice. Risks should be decomposable and delegated in order to offer insight at scale.
Phrased differently: We don&amp;rsquo;t expect a single person or team to assess and understand all the risks across an organization. Some federation of risk assessments need to occur, and we can do this by following the third axiom of probability when we break apart a risk.</description></item><item><title>Decision Standards</title><link>https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/docs/enterprise/decision-standards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/docs/enterprise/decision-standards/</guid><description>Carl Sagan once said &amp;quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&amp;quot;. For us, extraordinary decisions follow the same principle.
Leadership can require that a risk measurement meet certain requirements that defend it against negligence, cognitive error, corruption, imaginative failures, or gaps of evidence.
Here are some example thoughts on standardizing the level of expense expected for a measurement.

Trouble awaits for those who assign incentives (bonuses, promotions, etc) for directionally favorable changes in risk measurements, especially ones that rely on expert elicitation.
However, Key Results (OKR) and KPIs are still valuable leadership tools that assume values (in this case, a risk measurement) may correlate with some notion of success. While these approaches has leadership value, there are rough edges with metrics based management to consider which especially painful with risk metrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
